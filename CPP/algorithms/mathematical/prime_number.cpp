 * Function: is_prime
 * ------------------
 * Checks whether a given integer n is a prime number.
 *
 * n: the integer to check for primality.
 *
 * returns: true if n is prime, false otherwise.
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(sqrt(n))
 * - Only checks divisibility up to sqrt(n). If n = a * b,
 *   at least one of a or b must be <= sqrt(n), reducing iterations.
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
