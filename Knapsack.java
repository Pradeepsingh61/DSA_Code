public class Knapsack {

    //Description:
    // This function solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem to find the maximum value of items
    // that can fit within a limited weight capacity. It uses a bottom-up dynamic
    // programming approach by building a table of optimal solutions for all subproblems.

    //Time Complexity: O(n * W)
      //- Where 'n' is the number of items and 'W' is the knapsack capacity.
      //- The complexity arises from the nested loops used to fill the DP table of size (n+1) x (W+1).
     
      //Space Complexity: O(n * W)
      //- We use a 2D array (DP table) of size (n+1) x (W+1) to store the results of subproblems.
