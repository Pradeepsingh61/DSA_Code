/*
Longest Palindromic Subsequence

Problem Statement:
Given a string s, find the length of its longest palindromic subsequence. 
A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
A palindromic subsequence is a subsequence that reads the same forward and backward.

Examples:
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

Algorithm Description:
This algorithm computes the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in a string using dynamic programming. 
It leverages the fact that the longest palindromic subsequence of a string s is the same as the longest common subsequence (LCS) between s and its reverse.
A 2D DP table is constructed where dp[i][j] represents the length of the LCS between the first i characters of s and the first j characters of its reverse.
If the characters match, the LCS length increases by 1; otherwise, it takes the maximum from skipping a character from either string.

Use Cases:
- DNA/RNA sequence analysis for palindromic patterns
- Text analysis and pattern recognition
- Data compression and error correction

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
- Where n is the length of the input string. Each cell in the dp table is filled once.

Space Complexity: O(n^2)
- The dp table of size (n+1) x (n+1) is used to store intermediate results.
