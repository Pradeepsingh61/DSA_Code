package PaintHouse;

// There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

// The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an n x k cost matrix costs.

// For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on...
// Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: costs = [[1,5,3],[2,9,4]]
// Output: 5
// Explanation:
// Paint house 0 into color 0, paint house 1 into color 2. Minimum cost: 1 + 4 = 5; 
// Or paint house 0 into color 2, paint house 1 into color 0. Minimum cost: 3 + 2 = 5.
// Example 2:

// Input: costs = [[1,3],[2,4]]
// Output: 5

/*
Algorithm Description:
----------------------
This solution uses recursion with memoization (top-down dynamic programming) to find the minimum cost to paint all houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
- For each house, we try all possible colors except the color used for the previous house.
- We recursively compute the minimum cost for each choice and use a memoization table (dp) to avoid recomputation.
- The recursion starts from the first house with no previous color (-1).

Complexity Analysis:
--------------------
Let n be the number of houses and k be the number of colors.
- Time Complexity: O(n * k^2), since for each house and each color, we try up to k-1 colors for the next house and memoize results.
- Space Complexity: O(n * k) for the memoization table.
