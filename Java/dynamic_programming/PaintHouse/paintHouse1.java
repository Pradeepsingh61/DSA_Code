package PaintHouse;

// There is a row of n houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

// The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an n x 3 cost matrix costs.

// For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with the color red; costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...
// Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: costs = [[17,2,17],[16,16,5],[14,3,19]]
// Output: 10
// Explanation: Paint house 0 into blue, paint house 1 into green, paint house 2 into blue.
// Minimum cost: 2 + 5 + 3 = 10.
// Example 2:

// Input: costs = [[7,6,2]]
// Output: 2

/*
Algorithm Description:
----------------------
This solution uses recursion with memoization (top-down dynamic programming) to find the minimum cost to paint all houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
- For each house, we try all possible colors (red, blue, green) except the color used for the previous house.
- We recursively compute the minimum cost for each choice and use a memoization table (dp) to avoid recomputation.
- The recursion starts from the first house with no previous color (-1).

Complexity Analysis:
--------------------
Let n be the number of houses.
- Time Complexity: O(n * 3), since for each house and each color, we compute the result once and memoize it.
- Space Complexity: O(n * 3) for the memoization table.
