/*
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) :- https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/description/

Problem Statement:
Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence. 
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.
If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Examples:
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0

Algorithm Description:
This algorithm computes the length of the longest common subsequence between two strings using dynamic programming. 
It builds a 2D table where each cell dp[i][j] represents the length of the LCS of the first i characters of text1 and the first j characters of text2.
If the current characters match, the LCS length increases by 1; otherwise, it takes the maximum from skipping a character from either string.

Use Cases:
- Comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences in bioinformatics
- File or version comparison tools (diff utilities)
- Text similarity and plagiarism detection

Time Complexity: O(n*m)
- Where n and m are the lengths of the two input strings. Each cell in the dp table is filled once.

Space Complexity: O(n*m)
- The dp table of size (n+1) x (m+1) is used to store intermediate results.
