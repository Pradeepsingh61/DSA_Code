"""
Sieve of Eratosthenes for Generating Prime Numbers

Problem Statement:
Finding all prime numbers up to a given limit is a classic problem in computer science and number theory. 
The naive approach of checking each number for primality individually has a time complexity of O(nâˆšn), 
which becomes inefficient for large limits.

Theory:
The Sieve of Eratosthenes, attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes, is an efficient 
algorithm to find all primes up to a given number n. 
It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2 as non-prime. 
Optimizations, such as skipping even numbers and starting marking from i*i, reduce memory usage and runtime.

Algorithm Steps:
1. Initialize a boolean array `sieve` where each index represents a number and False indicates a potential prime.
2. Explicitly include 2 as the only even prime.
3. Iterate through odd numbers starting from 3 up to sqrt(max):
   - If the number is unmarked, it is prime.
   - Mark all odd multiples of this number starting from i*i as non-prime.
4. After marking, collect all unmarked numbers (primes) including 2.

Advantages:
- Time complexity is O(n log log n), efficient for large n.
- Memory usage can be reduced by ignoring even numbers.
- Simple and elegant algorithm with clear implementation.

Use Cases:
- Cryptography
- Number theory computations
- Generating prime numbers for algorithmic problems
