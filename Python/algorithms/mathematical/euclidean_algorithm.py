# ðŸ“Œ Euclidean Algorithm for Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

"""
Algorithm: Euclidean Algorithm
Description: Computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers.
Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))) - The number of steps is proportional to the number of digits in the smaller number.
Space Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))) for recursive calls, O(1) for iterative.

def euclidean_algorithm_recursive(a, b):
    """
    Calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers using the Euclidean algorithm recursively.

    The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two
    numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.
    This process is repeated until one of the numbers becomes zero, and the other number is the GCD.

    Time Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))) - The number of steps is proportional to the number of digits in the smaller number.
    Space Complexity: O(log(min(a, b))) - Due to recursive call stack.

    Args:
        a (int): The first non-negative integer.
        b (int): The second non-negative integer.

    Returns:
        int: The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of a and b.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If either a or b is negative.
