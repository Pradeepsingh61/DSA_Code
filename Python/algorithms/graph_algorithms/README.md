# Graph Algorithms in Python

This directory contains implementations of fundamental graph algorithms in Python, showcasing various graph traversal, shortest path, and spanning tree algorithms.

## üìÅ Available Implementations

### 1. Dijkstra's Algorithm - `dijkstra_algorithm.py`
**Description**: Finds shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

**Key Features**:
- Single-source shortest path algorithm
- Handles weighted graphs with non-negative weights
- Uses priority queue for efficient vertex selection
- Provides path reconstruction

**Time Complexity**: O((V + E) log V) using priority queue  
**Space Complexity**: O(V)

**Applications**:
- GPS navigation systems
- Network routing protocols
- Social network analysis
- Game pathfinding

### 2. Kruskal's Algorithm - `kruskals_algorithm.py`
**Description**: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph using greedy approach and Union-Find data structure.

**Key Features**:
- Greedy algorithm for MST construction
- Union-Find data structure for cycle detection
- Step-by-step execution tracking
- Interactive and demonstration modes
- Comprehensive error handling and validation

**Time Complexity**: O(E log E) where E is the number of edges  
**Space Complexity**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices

**Applications**:
- Network design (connecting cities with minimum cost)
- Circuit design and VLSI layout
- Clustering algorithms
- Image segmentation
- Approximation algorithms for TSP

**Code Highlights**:
```python
# Create graph and add edges
graph = Graph(6)
graph.add_edge(0, 1, 4)
graph.add_edge(1, 2, 1)
graph.add_edge(2, 3, 4)

# Find MST using Kruskal's algorithm
mst_edges, total_weight = kruskals_mst(graph)
print(f"MST total weight: {total_weight}")

# Get step-by-step execution
mst_edges, weight, steps = kruskals_with_steps(graph)
for step in steps:
    print(step)
```

**Union-Find Data Structure**:
- **Path Compression**: Optimizes find operations
- **Union by Rank**: Balances tree height during union operations
- **Cycle Detection**: Efficiently detects if adding an edge creates a cycle

## üöÄ How to Run

### Run Dijkstra's Algorithm
```bash
python dijkstra_algorithm.py
```

### Run Kruskal's Algorithm
```bash
python kruskals_algorithm.py
```

### Program Modes
Both implementations offer:
1. **Interactive Mode**: Create custom graphs and see results
2. **Demonstration Mode**: Pre-built examples with detailed explanations

## üìä Algorithm Comparison

| Algorithm | Type | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Use Case |
|-----------|------|----------------|------------------|----------|

    1: [(0, 4), (2, 1)],
    2: [(0, 3), (1, 1)]
}
```

**Edge List Format**:
```python
edges = [
    (0, 1, 4),  # (u, v, weight)
