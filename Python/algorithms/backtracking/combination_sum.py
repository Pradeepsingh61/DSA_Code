# ðŸ“Œ Combination Sum Algorithm

"""
Algorithm: Combination Sum
Description: Finds all unique combinations in a given set of numbers (candidates) where the candidate numbers sum to a target.
Each number in candidates may only be used once in the combination.

This problem is typically solved using a backtracking approach.

Time Complexity: O(2^N) in the worst case, where N is the number of candidates. This is because, in the worst case, we might explore all possible subsets.
Space Complexity: O(target) for the recursion stack and to store the current combination.
