"""
Algorithm: Dijkstra's Shortest Path
Purpose: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

Time Complexity: O((V + E) * log V), using a priority queue
Space Complexity: O(V + E), for adjacency list and distance tracking

Approach:
Uses a min-heap (priority queue) to greedily expand the shortest known paths.
Updates distances to neighbors if a shorter path is found.
